I've had some ups and downs in my 15 year software career but really came to love my craft.
For the last few years I've been developing enterprise web applications on various stacks with a real
interest in emerging JavaScript standards and frameworks. I really just want to give back to the
community in some small way since I've spent years reading others' blogs and using their software.  

I currently work at Unlimited Systems, Inc. in Cincinnati, OH.  We are a provider of revenue cycle
management software, helping medical practices manage their patient scheduling, claim management,
tasking, etc.
